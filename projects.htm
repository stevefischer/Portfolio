    <h3>Western Trailer Repair Website Update</h3>
        
    <p class="para">I was in charge of updating the company's website along with adding pages that helped understand who and what Western Trailer Repair Inc. is as a company, including the company/staff,  types of services they provide, what kind of products they sell, and how to best contact them.</p>

    <h3>County That!</h3>
    <p class="para"> This project I did in the Spring of 2019 part of my Web Scripting class I was taking. In the project, I demonstrate in an HTML document using a search bar to find a specific county within a list that is in alphabetical order on the page.</p>

        <h3>Guitars Galore</h3>
        
        <p class="para">The first website that I created was for my senior project as part of the Bachelor's of Applied Science in Information Systems (abbreviated BAS-IS) program while I attended Olympic College in Spring of 2018. </p>

        <p class="para">I chose this as my  project because of my enjoyment of playing guitar. I have played guitar for sixteen years now and over the years I have gained a lot of knowledge about many makes and models and that is what the intent of the website is showing. </p>

        <p class="para">The website is an information site about five different models of guitars, as well as some essential accessories every guitarist needs to have in order to be successful when playing guitar. If you are looking into wanting to learn or purchasing a guitar of your own, the site also includes a "Resources" page giving the links to the most popular sites to look at for reference.</p>

    <h3>Create Your Pizza Order</h3>
        
    <p class="para">This project I did in the Spring of 2019 part of my Web Scripting class I was taking. In this project, I used JavaScript as the primary language, as well as CSS for the visuals of the website. It is a website that is created to order a pizza to your liking including the size of the pizza (small, medium, or large) and $2 for any topping of your choice (pepperoni, cheese, mushrooms, or olives). </p>

        <p class="para">This project I did in the Spring of 2019 part of my Web Scripting class I was taking. In the project, I use JSON as the primary programming language that lists the different types of equipment you need when playing guitar including the guitar itself, as well as amps if you are playing on an electric guitar. The items are listed in bullet point form.</p>
